    /* You are ALLOWED to edit this function only. And "You" must implement this function from scratch.
    This function simulates the behavior of the inferno. Inferno means flame.

    1. The inferno starts at the city named [currentCityName] with the burning power of [firePower]
    2. Burning process.
         - Check if the inferno is strong enough to destroys the city.
         - If it is, 
            - The city will be destroyed. Therefore include it as one of destroyed cities.
            - The inferno will spread to "ALL" of adjacent cities with the decreased power, except the one where the fire came from "previousCityName".
            - The process will be repeated for all spread cities.
         - If it isn't
            - The inferno will be contained and extinguished in that city.

    Let the world burns as you solve this problem.
